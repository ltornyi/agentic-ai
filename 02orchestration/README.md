# Idea: coordinating several agents

## Python environment setup

    python3 -m venv venv
    . ./venv/bin/activate
    pip install openai python-dotenv pydantic

## Deploy OpenAI model and set environment variables

create .env file and add variables to it:

    AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE"
    AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE"
    AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_HERE"

## 1_one_agent.py: refactor the one tool-using agent code implemented under 01tools

See the generic `Agent` class in `agent.py` and the specific `CustomerSupportAgent` implementation in `customer_support_agent.py`. Example chat:

* User: hi! who are you?
* Assistant: I'm a customer support agent for ACME Corp, here to help you with any issues you may have. What can I assist you with today?
* User: I want a refund
* Assistant: I'm happy to help with that, but could you please tell me the reason for the refund request?
* User: my cockroach trap doesn't work
* Assistant: I'm sorry to hear that! Have you had a chance to set it up according to the instructions?
* User: yes, I followed the instructions but it never activates
* Assistant: It sounds like there may be a malfunction. I can process a refund for you; would you like to proceed with that?
* User: yes please
* Assistant: look_up_item({'search_query': 'cockroach trap'})
Found item: item_12345

## 2_orchestration.py

Three agents: Triage, Customer Support and Sales. Triage knows about Sales and Service but those agents only know about Triage. Example chats below
