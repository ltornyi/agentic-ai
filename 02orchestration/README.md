# Idea: coordinating several agents

## Python environment setup

    python3 -m venv venv
    . ./venv/bin/activate
    pip install openai python-dotenv pydantic

## Deploy OpenAI model and set environment variables

create .env file and add variables to it:

    AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE"
    AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE"
    AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_HERE"

## 1_one_agent.py: refactor the one tool-using agent code implemented under 01tools

See the generic `Agent` class in `agent.py` and the specific `CustomerSupportAgent` implementation in `customer_support_agent.py`. Example chat:

* User: hi! who are you?
* Assistant: I'm a customer support agent for ACME Corp, here to help you with any issues you may have. What can I assist you with today?
* User: I want a refund
* Assistant: I'm happy to help with that, but could you please tell me the reason for the refund request?
* User: my cockroach trap doesn't work
* Assistant: I'm sorry to hear that! Have you had a chance to set it up according to the instructions?
* User: yes, I followed the instructions but it never activates
* Assistant: It sounds like there may be a malfunction. I can process a refund for you; would you like to proceed with that?
* User: yes please
* Assistant: look_up_item({'search_query': 'cockroach trap'})
Found item: item_12345
* Assistant: execute_refund({'item_id': 'item_12345', 'reason': 'malfunction'})

        ===Refund summary===
        Item ID: item_12345
        Reason: malfunction
        ====================
        Refund executed successfully.

* Assistant: Your refund has been successfully processed! If you need any more assistance, feel free to ask.

## 2_orchestration.py

Three agents: Triage, Customer Support and Sales. Triage knows about Sales and Service but those agents only know about Triage.

* User: who are you?
* Triage Agent: I'm ACME Corp's customer service bot, here to help you with your questions or concerns! How can I assist you today?
* User: I broke my cockroach trap
* Triage Agent: I'm sorry to hear that! Do you need help with a replacement or getting it repaired?
* User: yes
* Triage Agent: transfer_to_customer_service({})
* Customer Support Agent: Please hold on while I connect you with a customer support agent for further assistance.
* User: now what?
* Customer Support Agent: I understand there's an issue with your cockroach trap; could you describe how it broke?
* User: it just fell apart
* Customer Support Agent: Thank you for the details! I recommend checking if any parts can be reassembled or if you need a replacement. Would you like to go for a replacement?
* User: yes
* Customer Support Agent: look_up_item({'search_query': 'cockroach trap'})

        Found item: item_12345
* Customer Support Agent: I found a replacement cockroach trap for you. I'll proceed with the order now. Would you like to finalize that?
* User: yes
* Customer Support Agent: Great! I will process the order for the replacement cockroach trap now.
* Customer Support Agent: execute_refund({'item_id': 'item_12345', 'reason': 'replacement for broken item'})

        Item ID: item_12345
        Reason: replacement for broken item
        ====================
        Refund executed successfully.
